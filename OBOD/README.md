# On the Boundary of Dreams

The genius Dalí, would put a tin plate on the floor and then sit by a chair beside it, holding a spoon over the plate. He would then try to fall asleep. The moment that he began to doze the spoon would slip from his fingers and clang on the plate, immediately waking him in a state of maximum creativity. 

With the recent advances in artificial intelligence and its application on art I ask myself the following questions: 

Can art be automated? Can neural art be creative or is it bounded by human imagination?

In this work I aim to explore the state of subconsciousness and the boundaries between sleeping and waking as a source of creativity. I used a custom generative adversarial network with attention mechanisms to generate patterns and shapes reminiscent of Dalí’s creative process. I selected a set of psychedelic art to induce the network into a state of surrealism and distortion. The output, an endless imaginative collection is then blended to Dalinean style paintings using a multimodal style transfer network.
